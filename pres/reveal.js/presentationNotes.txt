Intro:

API Info:

Definitions:

Slide 9:
Private ScaleGestureDetector - reference to our detector object.
mySGD = new ... - passing it this activity and passing it our custom scale listener.
inside touch event - making sure we pass each touch event to our scale detector.

Slide 10:
Building our custom scale listener.
Since we're extending we don't have to implement everything.
As part of the onScale method we receive some ScaleGestureDetector event, which we can then examine to view the factor.
This factor is the scaling factor, 1+-epsilon.

Init:
View - Just a superclass for GUI elements - lots of subclasses.
GestureOverlayView - This is the transparent overlay that drew the checkmarks. Specifically for gestures.
Inflate - Takes your raw boring old xml and will turn it into a fully functional view.
Add the transparent one into this newly inflated one.
Add a gesture listener to that view.

GestureLibrary - Actual storage of custom gestures.
GestureLibraries - Class which contains methods to work with gestures.

Load gesture lib stuff.

setContentView - Set the view of the activity to the view we built.

Detection:
Method is part of the main activity class. Is handled as a call back.
Breaks down your gesture library into some list, and then tries to score them.
If the score is over some threshold then youre gesture would return true or something.

Question Stuff:

Multi Touch - You have to write your own implementation as some sort of touch events. From there you use MotionEvents built in action types - DOWN/UP/HELD - and its array of pointers on the screen to determine what is happening and as such recognize if it is a valid gesture or not.

Rotate gesture stuff - See above.

GestureDetector - Class which detects various gestures and events using MotionEvents. GestureDector.SimpleOnGestureListener and ones like it are callbacks which notify when a particular event happens.
