Removing a fair amount of stuff from the default presentation so that it's usable.

Stuff Removed:
-Markdown stuff? Not sure what it is.
-Transition styles example.
-Theme changing example.
-Slide by slide transitions.
-Quote stuff.
-Inter-slide linking.
-Speaker view.
-PDF exports. Can be put back in later to give Earl his copy of stuff.
-Global States? Not sure what this is used for.
-State events? Not a clue why this is a thing.
-Last few linking slides to more stuff like auto scrolling slides.

Note for Stacey: 
-We can customize the transitions and themes fairly easily.
-If you don't like them we can change them.
-You can press ESC to go to the slide view.
-Figured out how to turn spellcheck off easily. Yay :D.
-Can use the table code to nicely organize the API info!
-List things or bullet examples for the functions we can use.
-Video/gif examples still exist.
-Subsection stuff - basementing - still in and easy to use.
-Earl mentioned that he wanted us to make sure there we slide numbers.
-reveal.js is awesome and I was able to put it in right away easily.
